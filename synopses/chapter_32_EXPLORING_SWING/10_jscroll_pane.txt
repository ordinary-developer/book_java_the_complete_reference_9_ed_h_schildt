 =====

 "JScrollPane" is a lightweight container that automatically handles
 the scrolling of another component.

 "JScrollPane" defines several constructors.
 One of them
    - JScrollPane(Component comp)
 The component to be scrolled is specified by "comp".

 Scroll bars automatically displayed when the content of the pane
 exceeds the dimensions of the viewport (the viewable area 
 of a scroll pane).

 Here are the steps to follow to use a scroll pane:
 1. Create the component to be scrolled.
 2. Create an instance of "JScrollPane", 
    passing to it the object to scroll.
 3. Add the scroll pane to the content pane.
