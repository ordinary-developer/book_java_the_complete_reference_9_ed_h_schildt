 type wrappers
 -------------

 The type wrappers are 
 Double, Float, Long, Integer, Short, Byte, Character, Boolean

 The process of encapsulating a value within an object is called boxing.
 The process of extracting a value from a type wrapper is called unboxing.

 Autoboxing is the process by which a primitive type is automatically encapsulated
 (boxed) into its equivalent type wrapper whenever an object of that type is needed.

 Auto-unboxing is the process by which the value of a boxed object is automatically
 extracted (unboxed) from a type wrapper when its value is needed.

 In general, autoboxing and unboxing take place whenever a conversion into an object
 or from an object is required.
