 annotations basics
 ==================

 An annotations is created through a mechanism based on the "interface"
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | // A simple annotation type                                      |
 | @interface MyAnno {                                              |
 |     String str();                                                |
 |     int val();                                                   |
 | }                                                                |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 All annotations consist solely of method declarations. However, 
 you don't provide bodies for these methods. Instead, Java implements
 these methods. Moreover, the methods act much like fields, as you will see.

 You can apply your annotation to something
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | @MyAnno(str = "Annotation Example", val = 100)                   |
 | public static void myMeth() { //...                              |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 An annotation cannot include an "extends" clause. However, all
 annotation types automatically extend the "Annotation" interface.
 Thus, "Annotation" is a super-interface of all annotations.
 It is declared within the "java.lang.annotation" package.
 It overrides "hashCode()", "equals()", and "toString()", which
 are defined by "Object". It also specifies "annotationType()",
 which returns a "Class" object that represents the invoking
 annotation. 

 Any type of declaration (in JDK 8) can have an annotation
 associated with it (classes, methods, fields, parameters,
 enum constants, even annotations themselves).        

 
 retention policy
 ================

 A retention policy determines at what point an annotation
 is discarded. Java defindes thre such policies, which are 
 encapsulated within the "java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy"
 enumeration. 
 They are "SOURCE", "CLASS", and "RUNTIME".

 An annotation with a retention policy of "SOURCE" is retained
 only in the source file and is discarded during compilation.

 An annotation with a retention policy of "CLASS" is stored
 in the .class file during compilation. However, it is not
 available through the JVM during run time.

 An annotation with a retentiond policy of "RUNTIME" is stored
 in the .class file during compilation and is available through
 the JVM during run time.
 

 using default values
 ====================

 You can give annotation member default values that will be used 
 if no value is specified when the annotation is applied. A default 
 value is specified by adding a default clause to a member's 
 declaration. It has this general form:

 "type member() default vaule"

 for example
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)                              |
 | @interface MyAnno {                                              |
 |     String str() default "Testing";                              |       
 |     int val() default 9000;                                      |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------


 marker annotations
 ==================

 A market annotation is a special kind of annotation that contains 
 no members. Its sole purpose is to mark an item. Thus, its presence
 as an annotation is sufficient.

 
 annotations restrictions
 ========================

 No annotations can inherit another.

 All method declared by an annotation must be withou parameters.

 Furthermore, they must return one of the following
 - a primitive type, such as "int" or "double"
 - an object of type "String" or "Class"
 - an "enum" type
 - another annotation type
 - an array of one of the preceding types

 Annotations cannot be generic. (In other words, they cannot take
 type parameters).
 Annotation methods cannot specify a "throws" clause.
