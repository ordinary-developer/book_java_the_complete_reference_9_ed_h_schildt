 window fundamentals
 ===================

 The AWT classes are contained in the "java.awt" package.

 At the top of the AWT hierarchy is the "Component" class.

 The "Container" class is a subclass of of "Component".
 It has additional methods that allow other "Component" objects
 to be nested within it.

 The "Panel" class is a concrete subclass of "Container".

 The "Window" class creates a top-level window.

 The "Frame" class is a subclass of "Window" and has a title bar,
 menu bar, borders, and resizing corners.

 Derived from "Component", "Canvas" encapsulates a blank window
 upon which you can draw.
