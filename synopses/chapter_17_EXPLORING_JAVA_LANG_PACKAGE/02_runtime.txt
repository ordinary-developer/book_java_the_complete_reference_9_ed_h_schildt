 Runtime
 =======

 The "Runtime" class encapsulated the run-time environment. You cannot instantiate a "Runtime"
 object, but you ca get a reference to the current "Runtime" object by calling the static
 method "Runtime.getRuntime()"

 an instance of the class Runtime has the next methods
 
 - long totalMemory()
        returns the total amount of memory for JVM

 - long freeMemory()
        returns the size of free memory fro JVM

 - void gc()
        initiates the calling of Java's garbage collector

 - Process exec(...)
        has several forms which allow you to name the program
        you want to run as well as its input parameters.
        The exec() methods returns a "Process" object, which
        can then be used to control how your Java program
        interacts with this new running process.

 - destroy()
        kills the subprocess

 - waitFor()
        causes your program to wait until the subprocess
        finishes

 - exitValue()
        returns the value returned by the subprocess
        when it is finished


 ProcessBuilder provides another way to start and manager processes
 (that is, programs)
