 awt control fundamentals
 ========================

 The awt supports the following types of controls:
 
 - Labels
 - Push buttons
 - Check boxes
 - Choice lists
 - Lists
 - Scroll bars
 - Text Editing

 These controls are subclasses of "Component".

 
 labels

 A label is an object of type "Label", and it contains a string,
 which it displays. Labels are passive controls 
 that do not support any interaction with the user.

 Label defines the following constructors:
 - Label( ) throws HeadlessException
 - Label(String str) throws HeadlessException
 - Label(String str, int how) throws HeadlessException

 The first version creates a blank label. 
 The second version creates a label that contains the string
 specified by str. This string is left-justified. 
 The third version creates a label that contains the string 
 specified by str using the alignment specified by how. 

 The value of "how" must be one of these three constants: 
 Label.LEFT, Label.RIGHT, or Label.CENTER.
 
 You can set or change the text in a label
 by using the "setText()" method. 
 You can obtain the current label by calling "getText()".

 These methods are shown here:
 - void setText(String str)
 - String getText( )

 For "setText( )", str specifies the new label.
 For getText( ), the current label is returned.

 You can set the alignment of the string within the label
 by calling "setAlignment( )". To obtain the current alignment, 
 call "getAlignment( )".
 
 The methods are as follows:
 - void setAlignment(int how)
 - int getAlignment( )

 Here, "how" must be one of the alignment constants shown earlier.
