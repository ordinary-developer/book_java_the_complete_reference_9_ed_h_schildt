 Label
 =====

 The JavaFX label is an instance of the "Label" class, 
 which is packaged in "javafx.scene.control".

 "Label" inherits the "Labeled" and "Control" classes.

 Once you have created a label (or any other control), it must be 
 added to the scene's content, which means adding to the scene graph.
 To do this, you will first call "getChildren()" on the root node
 of the scene graph. It returns a list of the child nodes in the form
 of an "ObservableList<Node>". "ObservableList" is packaged in 
 "javafx.collections", and it inherits "java.util.List". Using 
 the returned list of child nodes, you can add the label to the list
 by calling "add()", passing a reference to the label.
