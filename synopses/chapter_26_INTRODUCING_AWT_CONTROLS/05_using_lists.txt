 using lists
 ===========

 The "List" class provides a compact, multiple-choice,
 scrolling selection list.
 A *List* object can be constructed to show any number of choices
 in the visible window.


 handling lists
 ==============

 Each time a "List" item is double-clicked, an "ActionEvent" object
 is generated.
 Also, each time an item is selected or deselected with a single click,
 an "ItemEvent" object is generated.
