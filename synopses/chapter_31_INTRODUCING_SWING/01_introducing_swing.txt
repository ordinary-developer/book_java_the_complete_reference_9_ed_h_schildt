 introducing swing
 =================

 A swing GUI constists of two key items: components and containers.


 Components
 ==========

 In general, Swing components are derived from the "JComponent" class.
 All of Swing's components are represented by classes defined 
 within the package "javax.swing".


 Containers
 ==========

 Swing defines two types of containers.

 The first are top-level containers:
 "JFrame", "JApplet", "JWindow" and "JDialog".
 They do not inherit "JComponent" but inherit the AWT classes 
 "Component" and "Container".
 The top-level containers are heavyweight.

 The second type of containers are lightweight containers.
 Lightweight containers do inherit "JComponent".
