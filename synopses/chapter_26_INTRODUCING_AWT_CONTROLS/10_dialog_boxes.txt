 dialog boxes
 ============

 Dialog boxes may be modal or modeless.

 When a modal dialog box is active, all input is directed to it
 until it is closed.

 When a modeless dialog box is active, input focus can be directed
 to another window in your program.


 FileDialog
 ==========

 Java provides a built-in dialog box that lets the user specify a file.
