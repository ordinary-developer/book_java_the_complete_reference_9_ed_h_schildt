 The ArrayList Class
 ===================

 The "ArrayList" class extends "AbstractList" and implements "List" inteface.
 "ArrayList" is a generic class that has this declaration:
    class ArrayList<E>
 "ArrayList" supports dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.

 "ArrayList" has the constructors shown here:
 - ArrayList()
 - ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c)
 - ArrayList(int capacity)

 ArrayList's methods

 - void ensureCapacity(int cap)
        increases the capacity of the arraylist 
 
 - void trimToSize()
        reduces the size of the array that underlies an "ArrayList" object
        so that it is precisely as large as the number of items that it is
        currently holding.

 - object[] toArray()               | -> covert an "ArrayList" to an array
 - <T> T[] toArray(T array[])       |
