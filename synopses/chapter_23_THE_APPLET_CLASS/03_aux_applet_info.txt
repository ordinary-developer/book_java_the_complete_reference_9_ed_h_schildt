 simple applet display methods
 =============================

 - void drawString(String message, int x, int y)
    the member of the "Graphics" class, 
    used to output a string to an applet.
    Typically, it is called from within 
    either "update()" or "paint()" method.

 - void setBackground(Color newColor)
    sets the background of an applet'w window

 - void setForeground(Color newColor)
    sets the foreground of an applet'w window


 requesting repainting
 =====================

 Whenever your applet needs to update the information
 displayed in its window, it simply calls "repaint()".

 
 passing parameters to applets
 =============================

 the "APPLET" tag allows you to pass parameters to your applet.
 To retrieve a parameter, use the "getParameter()" method.
 It returns the value of the specified parameter in the form 
 of a "String" object. Thus, for numeric and boolean values, 
 you will need to convert their string representations into their
 internal formats

 Java will allow the applet to load data from the directory holding
 the HTML file that started the applet (the document base) and the
 directory from which the applet's class was loaded (the code base).
 These directories are returned as URL objects by "getDocumentsBase()"
 and "getCodeBase()". They can be concatenated with a string that
 names the file you want to load.

 To allow your applet to transfer control to another URL, you must
 use the "ShowDocument()" method defined by the "AppletContext" 
 interface.
 "AppletContext" is an interface that lets you get information from
 the applet's execution environment.
 The context of the currently executing applet is obtained by a call
 to the "getAppletContext()" method defined by "Applet".
