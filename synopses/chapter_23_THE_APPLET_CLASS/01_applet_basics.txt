 Applet basics

 applet launching
 ================

 1. include an "<applet>" comment in your source file
 2. compile your source file with an applet
 3. run "appletviewer" with a source file.

 two types of applets
 ====================

 There are two varieties of applets base on "Applet".
 - The first are those base directly on the "Applet" class.
   These applets use the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to provide
   the graphical user interface (or use no GUI at all).
 - The second type of applets are those based on the swing class "JApplet",
   which inherits "Applet".


 applet basics
 =============

 Execution of an applet does not begin at "main()". Actually, few applets
 even have "main()" methods.

 Output to your applet's window in not performed by 
 "System.out.println()". Rather, in an AWT-based applet, output is handled
 with various AWT methods, such as "drawString()", which outputs a string 
 to a specified X, Y location. Input is also handled differently that
 in a console application.
 
 "Applet" extends the AWT class "Panel". In turn, "Panel" extends "Container",
 which extends "Component". These classes provide support for Java's window-based,
 graphical interface. Thus, "Applet" provides all of the necessary support for
 window-based activities.

 Applets are event driven.

 The usere initiates interactin with an applet.

 There are a set of applet methods that controls its execution
 - init()
 - start()
 - stop()
 - destroy()

 AWT-based applets will also often override the "paint() method,
 which is defined by the AWT "Component" class.

 
 applet initialization and termination
 =====================================

 When an applet begins, the following methods are called, in this sequence:
 
 1. - init() 
    The "init()" method is the first method to be called. This is where you should
    initialize variables. This method is called only once during the run time of your applet.
 2. - start()
    The "start()" method is called after "init()". It is also called to restart an applet 
    after it has been stopped. Whereas "init()" is called once - the first time an applet 
    is loaded - "start()" is called each time an applet's HTML document is displayed onscreen.
 3. - paint()
    The "paint()" method is called each time an AWT-based applet's output must be redrawn.
    The "paint()" method has one parameter of type "Graphics". This parameter will contain
    the graphics context, which describes the graphics environment in which the applet 
    is running.

 When an applet is terminated, the following sequence of method calls takes place
 
 1. - stop()
    The "stop()" method is caleld when a web browser leaves the HTML document
    containing the applet - when it goes to another page, for example. 
    When "stop()" is called, the applet is probably running. You should use "stop()"
    to suspend threads that don't need to run when the applet is not visible.
    You can restart them when "start()" is called if the user returns to the page.
 2. - destroy()
    The "destroy()" method is called when the environment determines that your applet
    needs to be removed completely from memory. At this point, you should free up any
    resources the applet may be using. The "stop()" method is always called before "destroy()".
