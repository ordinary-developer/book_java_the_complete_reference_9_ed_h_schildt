 The "System" class holds a collection of static methods and variables.
 The standard input, output, and error output of the Java run time
 are stored in the "in", "out", and "err" variables.

 - static long currentTimeMillis()
        returns the current time in terms of milliseconds since
        midnight, January 1, 1970.

 - static long nanoTime()
        returns the current time in terms of nanosecond 
        (may be since midnight, January 1, 1970)

 - static void arraycopy(Object source, int sourceStart,
                         Object target, int targetStart, int size)
        copies an array. The array to be copied is passed in "source",
        and the index at which point the copy will begin within "source"
        is passed in "sourceStart". The array that will receive the copy
        is passed in "target", and the index at which point the copy will
        begin within "target" is passed in "targetStart". "size" is the number
        of elements that are copied.

 - static String getProperty(String which)
        retunrs the property associated with which. A null object
        is returned if the desired property is not found
 
 - static String getProperty(String which, String default)
        returns the property associated with which. If the 
        desired property is not found, default is returned
