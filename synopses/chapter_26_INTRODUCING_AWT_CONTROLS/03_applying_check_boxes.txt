 applying check boxes
 ====================

 A "check box" is a control that is used to turn an option on or off.

 To retrieve the current state of a check box, call "getState()".
 To set its state, call "setState()".
 To obtain the current label associated with a check box,
 call "getLabel()".
 To set the label, call "setLabel()".


 handling check boxes
 ====================

 Each time a check box is selected or deselected, an item event 
 is generated. Each listener implements the "ItemListener" interface.
 That interface defines the "itemStateChanged()" method.
 An "ItemEvent" object is supplied as the argument to this method.


 checkbox group
 ==============

 To create a set of mutually exclusive check boxes, you must first
 define the group to which they will belong and then specify 
 that group when you construct the check boxes.
 Check box groups are objects of type "CheckboxGroup".
