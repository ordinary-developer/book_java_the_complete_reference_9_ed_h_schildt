 Random
 ======

 The "Random" class is a generator of pseudorandom number. 
 These are called pseudorandom numbers because they are simply
 uniformly distributed sequences.

 "Random" defines the following constructors
    - Random()
    - Random(long seed)

 If you initialize a "Random" object with a seed, you define
 the starting point for the random sequence.
 If you use the same seed to initialize another "Random" object,
 you will extract the same random sequence.
 If you want to generate different sequences, specify different seed values.
 One way to do this is to use the current time to seed a "Random" object.
