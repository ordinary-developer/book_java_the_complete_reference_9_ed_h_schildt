 Radio buttons
 =============

 Radio buttons are a group of mutually exclusive buttons, in which
 only one button can be selected at any one time.

 One of its constructors
    - JRadioButton(String str)

 Radio buttons must be configured into a group. A button group 
 is created by the "ButtonGroup" class. Elements are then added 
 to the button group via the following method:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | void add(AbstractButton ab)                                      |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 A "JRadioButton" generates action events, item events, and 
 change events each time the button selection changes.

 You can use a number of different ways to determine which button
 was selected.

 First, you can check its action command by calling 
 "getActionCommand()". By default, the action command is the same
 as the button label, but you can set the action command to something
 else by calling "setActionCommand()" on the radio button.

 Second, you can call "getSource()" on the "ActionEvent" object 
 and check that reference against the buttons.

 Third, you can check each radio button to find out which one is
 currently selected by calling "isSelected()" on each button.
