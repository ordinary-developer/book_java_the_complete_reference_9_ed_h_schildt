 using clone()
 =============

 The clone() method (the method of "Object" class)
 generates a duplicate copy of the object on which it is called. 
 Only classes that implement the "Cloneable" interface can be cloned.
 
 The "Cloneable" interface defines no members. It is used to indicate that a class
 allows a bitwise copy of an object (that is, a clone) to be mad. If you try to 
 call "clone()" on a class that does not implement "Cloneable", a "CloneNotSupportedException"
 is thrown. When a clone is made, the constructor for the object being cloned is not called.
 As implemented by "Object", a clone is simply an exact copy of the original.

 Cloning is a potentially dangerous action, because it can cause unintented side effects.

 The singnature the method:

 - Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException

 "clone()" is declared as "protected" inside "Object". This means that is must 
 either be called from within a method defined by the class that implements "Cloneable",
 or it must be explicitly overridden by that class so that it is public.

 In general, you should not implement "Cloneable" for any class without good reason.
