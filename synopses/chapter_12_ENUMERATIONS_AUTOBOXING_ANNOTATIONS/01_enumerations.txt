 enumerations
 ============ 

 An enumeraion is created using the "enum" keyword.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | enum Apple {                                                     |
 |      Jonathan, GoldenDel, RedDel, Winesap, Cortland              |
 | }                                                                |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each of the enumerations constans is an object of the class in which it is defined.
 
 An enumerations can't inherit another class.
 An enumeration cannot be a superclass.


 the values() and valueOf() methods
 ==================================

 All enumerations automatically contain two predefined methods:

 "public static enum-type[] values()"
    returns an array that contains a list of the enumeration constants.
    
 "public static enum-type valueOf(String str)"
    returns the enumerations contstant whose value correspends to the string
    passed in str.

 
 other enumeration methods
 =========================

 "final int ordinal()"
    retuns a value that indicates an enumeration contant's position 
    in the list of constants

 "final int compareTo(enum-type e)"
    returns a negative value, if the invoking constant has an ordinal value less than e
    returns zero if the two ordinal values are the same
    returns a posizitive value, if the invoking constant has an ordinal value greater than e
    Remember, both the invoking constant and e must be the same enumeration.

 You can compare for equality an enumeration constant with any other object bu using
 "equals()", which overrides the "equals()" method defined by "Object". 
 Although "equals()" can compare an enumeration constant to any other object, those
 two objects will be equal only if they both refer to the same constant, within the 
 same enumeration. Simply having ordinal values in common will not cause equals()
 to return true if the two constants are from different enumerations.

 Also you can compare two enumeration references for equality by using "==".
