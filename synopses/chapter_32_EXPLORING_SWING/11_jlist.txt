 basic
 =====

 In Swing, the basic list class is called "JList". It supports the selection 
 of one or more items from a list.

 "JList" is now declared like this:
    class JList<E>
 Here, "E" represents the type of the items in the list.

 "JList" provides several constructors. 
 One of them is
    - JList(E[] items)

 "JList" is based on two models. 
 The first is "ListModel". This interface defines how access to the list data
 archieved.
 The second model is the "ListSelectionModel" interface, which defines
 methods that determine what list item or items are selected.

 It is usefull to wrap a "JList" inside a "JScrollPane".

 A "JList" generated a "ListSelectionEvent" when the user makes or changes
 a selection. This event is alos generated when the user deselects an item.
 It is handled by implementing "ListSelectionListener". This listener
 specifies only one method, called "valueChanged()"
    - void valueChanged(ListSelectionEvent le)
 Here, "le" is a reference to the event.

 Both "ListSelectionEvent" and "ListSelectionListener" are packaged 
 in javax.swing.event.
