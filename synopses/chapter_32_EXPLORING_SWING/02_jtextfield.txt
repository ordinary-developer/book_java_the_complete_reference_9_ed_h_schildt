 JTextField
 ==========

 "JTextField" allows you to edit one line of text. It is derived from
 "JTextComponent". "JTextField" uses the "Document" interface for its
 model.

 Three of "JTextField"'s constructors are shown here:
    - JTextField(int cols)
    - JTextField(String str, int cols)
    - JTextField(String str)
 Here, "str" is the string to be initially presented, and "cols" is
 the number of columns in the text field. If no string is specified,
 the text field is initially empty. If the number of columns is not
 specified, the text field is sized to fit the specified string.

 "JTextField" generates events in response to user interaction.
 For example, an "ActionEvent" is fired when the user presses ENTER.
 A "CaretEvent" is fired each time the caret (i.e., the cursor) 
 changes position. ("CaretEvent" is packaged in "javax.swing.event").

 To obtain the text currently in the text field, call "getText()".
