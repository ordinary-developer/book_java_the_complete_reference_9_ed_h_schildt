 Formatter
 =========

 The "Formatter" class provides format conversions that let you 
 display numbers, strings, and time and date in virtually any format, you like.

 The most widely used constructor is
    - Formatter()

 After you have created a "Formatter", you can use it to create a formatted
 string. To do so use the "format()" method.
    - Formatter format(String fmtString, Object ... args)

 The "fmtString" consists of two types of items. 
 The first type is composed of characters that are simply copied
 to the output buffer. The second type contains format specifiers
 that define the way the subsequent arguments are displayed.

 In its simplest form, a format specifier begins with a percent sign followed
 by the format conversion specifier.
 In general, there must be the same number of arguments as there are format
 specifiers, and the format specifiers and the arguments are matched 
 in order from left to right.

 When an uppercase specifier is used, then letters are shown in uppercase.

 Java type-checks each format specifier against its corresponding argument.
 If the argument doesn't match, an "IllegalFormatException" is thrown.
