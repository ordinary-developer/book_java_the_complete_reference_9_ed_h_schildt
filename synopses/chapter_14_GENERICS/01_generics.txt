 generics
 ========

 Generic class can be declared by the following line
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | class Gen<T> { // ...                                            |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generics work only with Reference Types
 You cannot not use a primitive type, such as int or char.

 Here is the full syntax for declaring a reference to a geneirc
 class and insatnce creation:
     class-name<type-arg-list> var-name =
           new class-name<type-arg-list>(cons-arg-list);

 When specifying a type parameter, you can create an upper
 bound that declares the superclass from which all type
 arguments must be derived.
 "<T extends superclass>"
 This specifies that T can only be replace by superclass, 
 or subclass of superclass

 When specifying a bound that has a class and an interface,
 or multiple interfaces, use the "&" operator to connect them.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 | class Gen<T extends MyClass & MyInterface> { // ...              |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 The wildcard argument is specified by the ?, and it represents
 an unknown type.
 Here, "Stats<?>" matches any "Stats" object

 To establish an upper bound for a wildcard, use the following type
 of wildcard expression
 "<? extends superclass>"
 where "superclass" is the same of the class that serves as the upper
 bound. This is an inclusive clause because the class forming 
 the upper bound (that is, specified by "superclass") is also
 within bounds

 You can alos specify a lower bound for a wildcard by adding a "super"
 clause to a wildcard declaration. Here is its general form
 "<? super sublcass>"
 In this case, only classes that are superclasses of "subclass" are
 acceptable arguments. This is an inclusive clause.
