 CLASSPATH
 =========
 
 How does the Java run-time system know where to look for packages?
 - by default, the Java run-time system uses the current working directory
   if your package is in a subdirectory of the current directory
   it will be found
 - you can specify a directory path or paths by setting 
   the CLASSPATH environmental variable
 - you can use the "-classpath" option with "java" and "javac"
   to specify the path to your classes. 

 When the second two options are used, the class path must not
 include "MyPack", itself. It must simply specify the path to "MyPack".
