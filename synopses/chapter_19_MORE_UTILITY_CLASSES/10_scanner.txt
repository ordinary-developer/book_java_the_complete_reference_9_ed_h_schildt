 Scanner
 ======

 "Scanner" is the complement of "Formatter". It reads formatted input and
 converts it into its binary form. Scanner can be used to read input from 
 the console, a file, a string, or any source that implements 
 the "Readable" interface or ReadableByteChannel. For example, you can
 use "Scanner" to read a number from the keyboard and assign
 its value to a variable.

 A "Scanner" reads tokens from the underlying source that you specified
 when the "Scanner" was created.

 To use "Scanner" follow the next procedure:
 1. Determine if a specific type of input is available by calling one of 
    "Scanner"'s "hasNextX" methods, where X is the type of data desired.
 2. If input is available, read it by calling one of Scanner's "nextX" methods.
 3. Repeat the process until input is exhausted.
 4. Close the "Scanner" by calling "close()".

 If a "next" method cannot find the type of data it is looking for, 
 it throws an "InputMismathException". A "NoSuchElementException" is thrown
 if no more input is available.


 Setting delimiters
 ==================

 "Scanner" defines where a token starts and ends based on a set of delimiters.
 The default delimiters are the whitespace characters.

 It is possible to change the delimiters by calling the next methods
 of the "Scanner" class instance:

    - useDelimiter(String pattern)
    - useDelimiter(Pattern pattern) 

 Here, "pattern" is a regular epxression that specifies the delimiter set.

 You can obtain the current delimiter pattern by calling "delimiter()"

    - Pattern delimiter()
