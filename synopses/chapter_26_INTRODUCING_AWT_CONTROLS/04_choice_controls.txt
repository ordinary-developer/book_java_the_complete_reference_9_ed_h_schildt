 choice controls
 ===============

 The "Choice" class is used to create a pop-up list of items 
 from which the user may choose.

 "Choice" defines only the default constructor, which creates an
 empty list.


 handling choice lists
 =====================

 Each time a choice is selected, an item event is generated.

 Each listener implements the "ItemListener" interface.
 That interface defines the "itemStateChanged()" method.
 An *ItemEvent* object is supplied as the argument to this method.
