 basic
 =====

 A tree is a component that presents a hierarchical view of data. 
 The user has the ability to expand or collapse individual subtrees in 
 this display. Trees are implemented in Swing by the "JTree" class.

 A simpling of its constructors is shown here:
    - JTree(Object obj[])
    - JTree(Vector<?> v)
    - JTree(TreeNode tn)

 Althouge "JTree" is packaged in "javax.swing", its support classes
 and interfaces are packaged in "javax.swing.tree".

 A "JTree generates a variety of events, but three relate specifically to trees
 - "TreeExpansionEvent"
 - "TreeSelectionEvent"
 - "TreeModelEvent"

 A "TreeExpansionEvent" is generated when a node is expanded or collapsed.
 A "TreeSelectionEvent" is generated when the user selects or deselect
 a node within the tree.
 A "TreeModelEvent" is fired when the data or structure of the tree changes.
 The listeners for these events are respectively
 - "TreeExpansionListener"
 - "TreeSelectionListener"
 - "TreeModelListener"

 The tree event classes and listener interfaces are packaged in 
 "javax.swing.event".

 Here are the steps to follow to use a tree:
 1. Create an instance of "JTree".
 2. Create a "JScrollPane" and specify the tree as the object to be scrolled.
 3. Add the tree to the scroll pane.
 4. Add the scroll pane to the content pane.
