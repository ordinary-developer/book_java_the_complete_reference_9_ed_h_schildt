 applet initialization and termination
 =====================================

 When an applet begins, the following methods are called, in this sequence:
 
 1. - init() 
    The "init()" method is the first method to be called. This is where you should
    initialize variables. This method is called only once during the run time of your applet.
 2. - start()
    The "start()" method is called after "init()". It is also called to restart an applet 
    after it has been stopped. Whereas "init()" is called once - the first time an applet 
    is loaded - "start()" is called each time an applet's HTML document is displayed onscreen.
 3. - paint()
    The "paint()" method is called each time an AWT-based applet's output must be redrawn.
    The "paint()" method has one parameter of type "Graphics". This parameter will contain
    the graphics context, which describes the graphics environment in which the applet 
    is running.

 When an applet is terminated, the following sequence of method calls takes place
 
 1. - stop()
    The "stop()" method is caleld when a web browser leaves the HTML document
    containing the applet - when it goes to another page, for example. 
    When "stop()" is called, the applet is probably running. You should use "stop()"
    to suspend threads that don't need to run when the applet is not visible.
    You can restart them when "start()" is called if the user returns to the page.
 2. - destroy()
    The "destroy()" method is called when the environment determines that your applet
    needs to be removed completely from memory. At this point, you should free up any
    resources the applet may be using. The "stop()" method is always called before "destroy()".
