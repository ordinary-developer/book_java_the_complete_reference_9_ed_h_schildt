 The concurrent api packages
 ===========================

 The concurrency utilities are containted 
 in the "java.util.concurrent" package and in its two subpackages:
 "java.util.concurrent.atomic" and "java.util.concurrent.locks"


 java.util.concurrent
 ====================

 "java.util.concurrent" defines the core features that support
 alternatives to the built-in approaches to synchronization 
 and interthread communication

 It defines
 - Synchronizers
 - Executors
 - Concurrent collections
 - The Fork/Join Framework"


 java.util.concurrent.atomic
 ===========================

 "java.util.concurrent.atomic" faciliates the use of variables in 
 a concurrent environment. It provides a means of efficiently
 updating the value of a variable without the use of locks.


 java.util.concurrent.locks
 ==========================
 "java.util.concurrent.locks" provides an alternative to use of 
 synchronized methods.
 At the core of this alternative is the "Lock" inteface, 
 which defines the basic mechanism used to acquire and relinqiush
 access to an object.
