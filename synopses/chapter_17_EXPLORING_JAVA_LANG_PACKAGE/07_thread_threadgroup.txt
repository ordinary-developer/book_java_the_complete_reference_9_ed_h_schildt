 Thread 
 ======

 "Thread" creates a new thread of execution. It implements "Runnable" and defines
 the following constructors
 
 - Thread()
 - Thread(Runnable threadOb)
 - Thread(Runnable threadOb, string threadName)
 - Thread(String threadName)
 - Thread(ThreadGroup groupOb, Runnable threadOb)
 - Thread(ThreadGroup groupOb, Runnable threadOb, String threadName)
 - Thread(ThreadGroup groupOb, String threadName)

 "threadOb" is an instance of a class that implements the Runnable interface and 
 defines where execution of the thread will begin. The name of the thread is 
 specified by "threadName". When a name is not specified, one is created by the JVM.
 "groupOb" specifies the thread group to which the new thread will belong.
 When  no thread group is specified, the new thread belongs to the same group 
 as the parent group.

 The "Thread" class defines many methods (omitted here).


 ThreadGroup
 ===========

 "ThreadGroup" creates a group of threads. It defines these two constructors:

 - ThreadGroup(String groupName)
 - ThreadGroup(ThreadGroup parentOb, String groupName)

 For both forms, group Name specifies the name of the thread group. 
 The first version creates a new group that has the current thread as its parent.
 In the second form, the parent is specified by "parentOb".

 It has many methods. Here are some of them
 
 - void list()
        Displays information about the group

 - int activeCount()
        returns the approximate number of active threads 
        in the invoking group (including those in subgroups)

 - int enumerate(Thread group[])
        puts the active threads that comprise the invoking thread group
        (including those in subgroups) into the group array.
        (has some overloaded version)
