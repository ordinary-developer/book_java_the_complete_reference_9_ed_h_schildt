 basic
 =====

 Swing provides a combo box (a combination of a text field and a drop-down list)
 through the "JComboBox" class.

 "JComboBox" is now declared like this:
    class JComboBox<E>
 Here, "E" represents the type of the items in the combo box.

 One of "JComboBox"'s constructors
    - JComboBox(E[] items)
 Here, "items" is an array that initializes the combo box.

 Items can be dynamically added to the list of choices
 via the "addItem()" method
    - void addItem(E obj)
 Here, "obj" is the object to be added to the combo box.

 "JComboBox" generates an action event when the user selects an item 
 from the list. "JComboBox" also generates an item event when the state
 of selection changes, which occurs when an item is selected or deselected.
 Thus, changing a selection means that two item events will occur:
 one for the deselected item and another for the selected item.

 One way to obtain the item selected in the list is to call 
 "getSelectedItem()" on the combo box.
    - Object getSelectedItem()
 You will need to cast the returned value into the type of object
 stored in the list.
