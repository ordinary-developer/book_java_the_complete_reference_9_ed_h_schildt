 JButton
 =======

 The "JButton" class provides the functionality of a push button.
 "JButton" allows an icon, a string, or both to be associated 
 with the push button.

 Three of its constructors are shown here:
    - JButton(Icon icon)
    - JButton(String str)
    - JButton(String str, Icon icon)

 When the button is pressed, an "ActionEvent" is generated.
 Using the "ActionEvent" object passed to the "actionPerformed()"
 method of the registered "ActionListener", you can obtain the
 action command string associated with the button. By defautl, this is
 the string displayed inside the button. 

 However, you can set the action command by calling 
 "setActionCommand()" on the button. You can obtain the action 
 command by calling "getActionCommand()" on the event object. 
 It is declared like this:
    String getActionCommand()
