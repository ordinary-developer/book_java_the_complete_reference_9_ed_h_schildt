 Image and ImageView
 ===================

 At the foundation for JavaFX's support for images are two classes:
 - "Image"
 - "ImageView"
 "Image" encapsulates the image, itself, 
 and "ImageView" managers the display of an image.
 Both classes are packaged in "javafx.scene.image".

 The "Image" class loads an image form either an "InputStream", a URL,
 or a path to the image file.

 One of "Image"'s constructors:
    - Image(String url)
 Here, "url" specifies a "URL" or a path to a file that supplies the image.

 "Image" is not derived from "Node". 
 Thus, it cannot, itself, be part of a scene graph.

 Once you have an "Image", you will use "ImageView" to display it.
 "ImageView" is derived from "Node", which means that it can be part 
 of a scene graph.

 One ot its constructors:
    - ImageView(Image image);
 This constructor creates an "ImageView" that uses "image" for its image.
