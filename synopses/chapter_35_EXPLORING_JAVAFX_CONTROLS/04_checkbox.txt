 CheckBox
 ========

 The "CheckBox" class encapsulates the functionality of a check box.
 
 Its immediate superclass is "ButtonBase".

 "CheckBox" support three states. The first two are checked or 
 unchecked. The third state is indeterminate (undefined).

 It is typically used to indicate that the state of the check box
 has not been set or that it is not relevant to a specific situation.
 If you need the indeterminate state, you will need to explicitly 
 enable it.

 "CheckBox" defines two constructors.
    - CheckBox() // default constructor
    - CheckBox(String str)
      Here str identifies the checkbox.
