 "JTable" is a component that displays rows and columns of data.

 "JTable"'s files are packaged in "javax.swing.table".

 "JTable" is a component that consists of one or more columns of information.
 At the top of each column is a heading. In addition to describing the data
 in a column, the heading also provides the mechanism by which the user can
 change the size of a column or change the location of a column within 
 the table. "JTable" does not provide any scrolling capabilities of its own.
 Instead, you will normally wrap a "JTable" inside a "JScrollPane".

 "JTable" supplies several constructors. The on used here is
    - JTable(Object data[][], Object colHeads[])

 A "JTable" can generate several different event. The two most fundamental
 to a table's operation are "ListSelectionEvent" and "TableModelEvent".
 A "ListSelectionEvent" is generated when the user selects something
 in the table. By default, "JTable" allows you to select one or more complete
 rows, but you can changed this behavior to allow one or more columns, 
 or one or more individual cells to be selected. 
 A "TableModelEvent" is fired when that table's data changes in some way.

 The steps required to set up a simple JTable:
 1. Create an instance of "JTable".
 2. Create a "JScrollPane" object, specifying the table as the object to scroll
 3. Add the table to the scroll pane.
 4. Add the scroll pane to the content pane.
