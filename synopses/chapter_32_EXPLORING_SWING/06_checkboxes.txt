 Check Boxes
 ###########

 The "JCheckBox" class provides the functionality of a check box.

 "JCheckBox" defines several constructors.
 The one used here is
    - JCheckBox(String str)

 When the user selects or deselects a check box, an "ItemEvent" 
 is generated. You can obtain a reference to the "JCheckBox" that
 generated the event by calling "getItem()" on the "ItemEvent" passed
 to the "itemStateChanged()" method defined by "ItemListener".

 The easiest way to determine the selected state of a check box
 is to call "isSelected()" on the "JCheckBox" instance.
