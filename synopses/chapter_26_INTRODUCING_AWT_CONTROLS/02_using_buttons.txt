 using buttons
 =============

 A push button is a component that contains a label and 
 that generates an event when it is pressed.
 Push buttons are objects of type "Button".

 "Button" defines these two constructors:
 - Button( ) throws HeadlessException
 - Button(String str) throws HeadlessException

 The first version creates an empty button.
 The second creates a button that contains str as a label.

 After a button has been created, you can set its label
 by calling "setLabel()".

 You can retrieve its label by calling "getLabel()".

 These methods are as follows:
 - void setLabel(String str)
 - String getLabel()

 Here, "str" becomes the new label for the button.


 handling buttons
 ================

 Each time a button is pressed, an action event is generated. 
 This is sent to any listeners that previously registered 
 an interest in receiving action event notifications
 from that component.

 Each listener implements the "ActionListener" interface.
 That interface defines the "actionPerformed()" method,
 which is called when an event occurs. 

 An "ActionEvent" object is supplied as the argument to this method.
 It contains both a reference to the button that generated the event
 and a reference to the action command string
 associated with the button.
 By default, the action command string is the label of the button. 
 Either the button reference or the action command string 
 can be used to identify the button.
