 layout managers
 ===============

 Each "Container" object has a layout manager associated with it.
 A layout manager is an instance of any class that implements the 
 "LayManager" inteface.
 The layout manager is set by the "setLayout()" method.

 If no call to "setLayout()" is made, then the default layout
 manager is used.


 FlowLayout
 ==========

 "FlowLayout" is the default layout manager.

 "FlowLayout" implements a simple layout style, which is similar 
 to how words flow in a text editor.


 BorderLayout
 ============

 The "BorderLayout" class implements a common layout style 
 for top-level windows. It has four narrow, fixed-width components
 at the edges and one large area in the center. The four sides are
 referred to as north, south, east, and west. The middle area 
 is called the center.


 Using insets
 ============

 To leave a small amount of space between the container that holds
 your components and the window that contains it, override 
 the "getInsets()" method that is defined by "Container". This method
 returns an "Insets" object that contains the top, bottom, left, 
 and right inset to be used when the container is displayed.


 GridLayout
 ==========

 "GridLayout" lays out components in a two-dimensional grid.
 When you instantiate a "GridLayout", you define the number of rows
 and columns.


 CardLayout
 ==========

 The "CardLayout" class can stores several different layouts.
 Each layout can be thought of as being on a separate index card
 in a deck that can be shuffled so that any card is on top at 
 a given time.
