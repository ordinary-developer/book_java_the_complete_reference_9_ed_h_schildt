 JTabbedPane
 ===========

 "JTabbedPane" encapsulates a tabbed pane.

 "JTabbedPane" has three constructors.
 Its default constructor creates and empty control with the tabs
 positioned accross the top of the pane.

 Tabs are added by calling "addTab()".
    - void addTab(String name, Component comp);
 Here, "name" is the name for the tab, and "comp" is the component
 that should be added to the tab.

 Often, the component added to a tab is a "JPanel" that contains 
 a group of related components.

 The general procedure to use a tabbed pane is outlined here:
 1. Create an instance of "JTabbedPane".
 2. Add each tab by calling "addTab()".
 3. Add the tabbed pane to the content pane.
